<h1>üöÄ Portfolio with 10 simple Projects (HTML, CSS and JS)</h1>

<p>üòç Hello! Coming back here on Github once again to show my progress in HTML, CSS and Javascript. 

I am very happy because I can already apply simple concepts, but that are very useful for building basic applications and that over time can evolve to more complex applications and features. </p>

<h2>For what is this Repository?</h2>

<p> 

I've built some applications to train and apply everything I've learned in HTML, CSS and Javascript. If you want to learn or improve each of them, feel free to make a FORK. 

You won't need to download or install any packages, only use HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript. </p>
