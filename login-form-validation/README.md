# üîê Login Validation Form 

Hello guys!

Today, I have some new features in this project. When I started Learning Web Development, the only thing that I can do is create some 
static pages, but now, I can increment some tools and messages with JavaScript. 

## What's about? 
This is simple, but I learned a lot! Is a simple login form validation with this three topics: 

- [X] The user can't access the system without an email (empty e-mail)
- [X] The user can't access without password
- [X] The user can't access if the password is equal a 'password'

Thank you so much!
